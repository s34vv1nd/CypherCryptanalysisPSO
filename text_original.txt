In traditional PSO, the velocity is added to the particle on
each dimension to update the particle, thus it is a distance
measure. If the velocity is larger, the particle may explore
more distant areas. Similarly, the new velocity in the
permutation scenario represents the possibility that the
particle changes. If the velocity is larger, the particle is more
likely to change to a new permutation sequence. The velocity
update formula remains the same. However the velocity is
limited to absolute values since it only represents the
difference between particles. The particle update process is
changed as follows: the velocity is normalized to the range of
0 to I by dividing it by the maximum range of the particle.
Then each position randomly determines if there is a swap
with a probability determined by the velocity. If a swap is
required, the position will set to the value of same position in
nBesf by swapping values.
